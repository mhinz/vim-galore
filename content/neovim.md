#### Help

See `:h nvim`. Seriously, do it. It contains a table of contents for all the
things that either changed or were added to Neovim.

#### Configuration

Neovim adheres to the [XDG Base Directory
Specification](http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html).
If you don't have them set already, `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` defaults to `~/.config`
and `$XDG_DATA_HOME` defaults to `~/.local/share`.

NOTE: The term "vimrc" doesn't refer to a filename, it refers to a configuration
file and is used by Vim and Neovim.

| Flavour | User configuration directory | User vimrc |
|---------|------------------------------|-------|
| Vim | `~/.vim` | `~/.vimrc` or `/.vim/vimrc` |
| Neovim | `~/.config/nvim` | `~/.config/nvim/init.vim` |

[Working files](../README.md#handling-backup-swap-undo-and-viminfo-files) are
put under `~/.local/share/nvim` by default.

If you want to share your vimrc with Neovim, you can easily do that like this
(assuming you already put your vimrc into `~/.vim` for clearer separation):

```sh
$ cd
$ ln -s .vim .config/nvim
$ cd .vim
$ ln -s vimrc init.vim
```

#### Terminal emulator

Neovim implements a proper terminal emulator
([libvterm](http://www.leonerd.org.uk/code/libvterm/)) and can easily fire up a
new shell via `:terminal`.

In Vim you run [interactive
programs](../README.md#running-external-programs-and-using-filters) like this:
`:!read foo && echo $foo`. In Neovim this won't work because `:!` uses named
pipes ([libuv processes](https://nikhilm.github.io/uvbook/processes.html)) for
communication now. Use `:te read foo && echo $foo` instead.

By now you might have noticed, that you can't leave the insert mode in a
terminal buffer via `<esc>`, since it gets captured by the terminal emulator
instead of Neovim. Use `<c-\><c-n>` instead.

Since terminal buffers are a new kind of buffer (`&buftype` is set to
"terminal"), there are also new commands for creating terminal
[mappings](../README.md#mappings): `:tmap`, `:tnoremap`, and `:tunmap`.

There are also two new [autocmd](../README.md#autocmds) events: `TermOpen` and
`TermClose`.

Here an example configuration:

```vim
if has('nvim')
  nnoremap <leader>t  :vsplit +terminal<cr>
  tnoremap <esc>      <c-\><c-n>
  tnoremap <a-h>      <c-\><c-n><c-w>h
  tnoremap <a-j>      <c-\><c-n><c-w>j
  tnoremap <a-k>      <c-\><c-n><c-w>k
  tnoremap <a-l>      <c-\><c-n><c-w>l
  autocmd BufEnter term://* startinsert
endif
```

#### Change cursor style dependent on mode

The method mentioned in the [Vim section](../README.md#change-cursor-style-in-insert-mode)
doesn't work in Neovim. Instead, define the environment variable
`NVIM_TUI_ENABLE_CURSOR_SHAPE`; see `man 1 nvim` for more information.
